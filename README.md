### AIM:

Natural sampling is a technique where the continuous-time signal is multiplied by a periodic impulse train, resulting in a series of samples at specific time intervals. The sampled signal is a reconstruction of the original signal at these discrete points. This approach preserves the amplitude of the signal at the sampling instants while discarding information between them.
